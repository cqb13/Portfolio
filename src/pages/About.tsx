              Hello, my name is <b>Maksim Straus</b>, I go by <b>cqb13</b>, Iâ€™m
              a {age} year old, self-taught,
              <b> web developer</b>. I excel at building websites that work well
              on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
              <br />
              <br />I have been programming for about 5 years now, and have
              learned many languages and frameworks. I started off learning{" "}
              <b>Python</b>, then after I becoming interested in Minecraft
              modding I learned <b>Java</b>. I learned a few more languages such
              as <b>C++</b> for game dev, but I never really got into them. But
              after taking a CS class in high school I became interested in web
              development, I learned <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> and then moved
              on to <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Typescript</b>. I am currently
              learning <b>Rust</b>.

              I use <b>vscode</b> as my main editor, but I also often use{" "}
              <b>IntelliJ</b>. My framework of choice is
              <b> React</b>, however I also have experience with <b>Vue</b>.
              <br />
              <br /> <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Typescript</b> are my main
              languages, for both frontend and backend. For styling I mainly use
              tailwind css . I have not delved too deep into backend
              development, but I some experience with <b>Node.js</b>, and{" "}
              <b>Rust</b>, and I am proficient with <b>Firebase</b> which I use
              for authentication, and databases, I am also learning <b>SQL</b>.
